# Instacart Basket Analysis

[Github Repository](https://github.com/kirstencurrie/cf_instacart)

## Intro

This was a theoretical Instacart project meant to analyze product sales via Products, Orders, and Customer datasets. 

Original data was accessed by Instacart and actual customer names & other variables such as prices had been imputed to protect information.

Leveraging Python using Jupyter Lab Notebooks, the Instacart data was cleaned, wrangled, and prepared for analysis. One of the datasets contained over 32 million rows of data, which in turn required troubleshooting techniques in order to run the study smoothly. In the end, sampling 20% of the data was selected in order to conduct the analysis.
