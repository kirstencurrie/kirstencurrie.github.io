## About

Hi, I'm Kirsten. I'm a data analyst with a background in apparel material development, having worked for industry leaders like Adidas and Nordstrom. During my career, I saw firsthand how **critical data is in making smart business decisions**—whether it’s optimizing supply chains, segmenting customers, or validating products. That realization inspired me to pivot into data analytics, combining my industry expertise with technical skills to help businesses uncover insights and drive innovation.

**I’ve always been fascinated by the stories data can tell**. Whether it’s tracking my own spending habits (I’ve logged every expense for the past five years!) or analyzing my health data—like calories, macros, and micronutrients—I love finding hidden patterns and using them to make sound decisions. That same curiosity drives me professionally as I dig into data to **reveal trends, solve problems, and create actionable strategies**.

If you're curious about how data can transform business strategy or want to see some of my work, check out some of my latest projects below. I’d love to connect and help uncover the hidden gems in your data!

### [Cary, NC Real Estate Analysis](project1.md)

What property features drive property values? Is it acreage? Proximity to schools? Property age? With exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques such as linear regression and clustering, this study dives into publicly available data on Cary, North Carolina property type features and values. These initial learnings could be leveraged by Real Estate investors or first-time home buyers to build a better understanding of where to locate well-positioned properties in terms of future growth of the city as well as where potential investment gems might be found.
