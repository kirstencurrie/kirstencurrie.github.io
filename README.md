## Work Experience
[Resume]

**Manager Golf Apparel Materials @ Adidas, Carlsbad, CA | (_June 2022 - Present_)**
- Merge >500,000 seasonal material records with volume reports, revealing fabrication type distribution to address gaps in saturated golf apparel market, & provide key stakeholders with direction for consumer driven, seasonal briefing.
  
- Drive innovative Twistweave™ & Twistknit™ fabric developments using proprietary technology for Men's ULT365+ range, creating lightweight, adaptive golf polos & pants, contributing to an overall 66.7% GIM.

**Founder & Head Intimates Designer @ Kirst LLC, Portland, OR | (_February 2020 - May 2021_)**
- Analyzed survey data from 100+ petite, larger cup-size women to identify garment fit issues, resulting in the development of a specialized low-back bra. Utilized data-driven insights to engineer a product with high market potential, as evidenced by customer willingness to spend up to $200 based on initial prototypes.

## Projects
### Data-Driven EEG Band Discovery with Decision Trees
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/8/3048)

Developed objective strategy for discovering optimal EEG bands based on signal power spectra using **Python**. This data-driven approach led to better characterization of the underlying power spectrum by identifying bands that outperformed the more commonly used band boundaries by a factor of two. The proposed method provides a fully automated and flexible approach to capturing key signal components and possibly discovering new indices of brain activity.

### Decoding Physical and Cognitive Impacts of Particulate Matter Concentrations at Ultra-Fine Scales
[Publication](https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/22/11/4240)

Used **Matlab** to train over 100 machine learning models which estimated particulate matter concentrations based on a suite of over 300 biometric variables. We found biometric variables can be used to accurately estimate particulate matter concentrations at ultra-fine spatial scales with high fidelity (r2 = 0.91) and that smaller particles are better estimated than larger ones. Inferring environmental conditions solely from biometric measurements allows us to disentangle key interactions between the environment and the body.
